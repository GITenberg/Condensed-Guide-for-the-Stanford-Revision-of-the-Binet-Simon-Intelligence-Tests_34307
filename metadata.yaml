description: '"Presents a condensed guide for the application of the Binet-Simon Intelligence
  Scale-Stanford revision. This guide is intended for use by experienced examiners
  as a supplement to the books The Measurement of Intelligence, and The Intelligence
  of School Children. For the further aid of the examiner a condensed record blank
  has also been prepared. For general directions for the use of the Stanford Revision,
  the reader is referred to Chapter VIII of The Measurement of Intelligence. However,
  ten suggestions are listed for the test administrator to keep in mind. Test questions
  for examinees aged 3 through 18 are listed and prompts to be used by the examiner
  are provided." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved).'
